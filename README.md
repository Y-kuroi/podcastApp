# Overview:
This project is part of my ReactNative and TypeScript study. I chose a podcast listening app out of my love for listening to podcasts.
+ The app was bootstrapped using **expo** so it will be required to run development build and or make modifications.
+ The app is by no means complete but I'll keep releasing builds whenever I have free time to work on it.
+ This app is intended as a mere **demo** , some features that are deemed essential might not be working. 

 ## Release:
 <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-oY_VuZByIhoL90oOtYdBUrpqiIzPZru/view?usp=sharing">Download APK</a>
 - What is not working:
    + Search
    + Menu (sort, refresh...)
    + Add new RSS feed manually.
    + Some minor UI features.
    + Discover. (Server or API is needed for this)
